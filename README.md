NOTE: Really old hobby project that hasn't been touched in way more than 3 years.

A Damage Calculator for an RPG-style game in Java from years back. Input health, applied damage, and a number of modifiers.

Includes a quick calculator, an advanced more complicated calculator, and a silly game example generator.

If the indentation is screwy on some of these files - sorry! I'm not sure what's wrong since they look fine outside of GitHub.
